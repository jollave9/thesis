incase of pi's ip is changing:
- set SERVER in clienttcp.py to the current pi's ip.
- inside the raspberry pi, change the content of /etc/hosts/ because tcpclassify.py will throw an error if hosts is not configured right

        /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost
#127.0.1.1      raspberrypi
#192.168.43.111 raspberrypi
192.168.1.11    raspberrypi #change this to the current ip if error

NOTE: setting static ip in pi might cause problem in connectivity and might become unaccessible.
